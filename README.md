# Hi there 👋

### 🔍 About Me
I'm Kamil, a self-taught Data Analyst who found his passion for data analytics in 2021 during a year-long work placement. I've always liked working with numbers and solving complex math problems or puzzles, so when I discovered the world of data analytics I was immediately captivated by it. The challenge of uncovering stories by diving deep into data, identifying trends and trying to make sense of the numbers is what fuels my passion every day.
